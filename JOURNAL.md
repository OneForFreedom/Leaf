## 10/26/2025 - Alright, Formalities.   

Woah! 4 hours? What in the fraud did YOU do Freedom? Well that's probably what's zooming through your head. Well this is the time I used whilst also using hackatime. This hackatime extension stole half my tracked time away. So I was left with 2 hours. But I'll need justice, so I'm journalling so I get my hours right. Btw I made decent progress with a leaf. The process of making it  is pretty time consuming. So it isn't hard to believe that it took 4 hours. I also had to reiterate it many times just for this measly thing to pop up. Well Ig you'd ought to see it. So here it is! Oh yea one more thing. This journal is written retrospectively.

## 10/28/2025 10 PM - Coloured a leaf?  

So basically, i spent like 18 minutes going back and forth deciding on what the colour of the leaf should be. I settled with a warm dark oak sort of colour. Uhh the screenshot should accurately depict on what was implied. This is prolly the first leaf I'm gonna do. I am gonna spend my sweet sweet time on the next two.

## 10/29/2025 - What?  

Edit: I printed it and stuck it to my monitor.

Ts was not meant to take 1.7 hours :Heavysob: I was expecting this to take me like 12 minutes, but then I realised that this was meant to have much much MUCH more detail. So here it is.

I'm gonna have to spend time actually making the stems and all
