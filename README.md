# Leaf

It's 8am. The morning birds are chirping. The autumn breeze glides gently through your hair. It's calm, it's tranquil. You walk through a forest. You hear all kinds of wildlife, all kinds of animals singing their lullabies to their little ones. You smell the fresh smell of autumn, a smell so distinct yet so vague. You look above - the leaves of the trees are in all kinds of colours: *crimson, sienna, olive, and even goldenrod.*  

As you walk through the forest, leaves start falling around you one by one. One lands in front of you. It's a beautiful leaf. The colour of *amber*. A rather elegant hue.
