## Entry 1: The elephant in the classroom.

Okay lets address the elephant in the classroom. (Not really.)
Making a leaf is hard. Not insanely hard, but hard if you don't know what you're doing. Which is why I spent 4 hours with absalutely no progress whatsoever (aside from a measly leaf). Hackatime was no help either, tracking half of every minute. like wtf?
I had to resort to the old fasion way of journalling. With the added benifit of being able to use fusion.

Here's an image of my measly leaf. I prolly should restart ts:

Wait, yk what, ima use blueprint to journal ts. I can add images really easily.
